# React Boilerplate with gulp, node, and webpack

```
$ git clone git@github.com:richi1717/react-boilerplate.git
$ npm i
$ gulp dev
```

May have to install gulp, webpack, and or node sass:

```
$ npm i -g gulp webpack node-sass
```

Then go to localhost:3000.

`server.js` is already set up to handle different routes and so is react-router.
